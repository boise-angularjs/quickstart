# Angular 2 Quickstart


The Angular 2 quickstart includes all of the dependencies for writing Angular 2 in your browser.

The quickstart contains
 - Pre-built ES5 version of [Angular 2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2) alpha-14
 - Pre-built ES5 version of [rtts-assert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtts-assert) alpha-7
 - The es6-shim, which includes Traceur, ES6 Module Loader, System, Zone, and Traceur options for meta-data annotations.

# Getting Started

This a fork of the Angular 2 quickstart from [angular.io](https://angular.io/). To get running, just install `http-server` and you're good to go.

```js
# From the directory that contains index.html:
npm install -g http-server # Or sudo npm install -g http-server
```

```js
http-server # Creates a server at localhost:8080
# In a browser, visit localhost:8080/index.html
```
